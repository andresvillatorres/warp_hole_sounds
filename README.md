This repository contains the Processing Code for the Warphole Sounds Performance presented at Leeds in 2015 as part of the first international conference on live coding
The Processing Sketch is a particle simulation of strong gravitational forces. The physics behind are relatively simple and more or less as follow:

- A random distributed array of invisible attractor particles throughout a spheric field, spin at modulable rates. 
- The radius of the spheric field is also modulable.
- Visible particles are attracted to the rest of the spinning attractors.
- Modulation of the several parameters such as gravity, inertia, rotation speeds in the three dimensions, and radius of the field
allowed me as performer to "intuitively" move between chaos and organized states.

Back in the days I was obsessed with quantum physics and uncertain states. So I built a self-conceived newtonian model of a blackhole.
I called it a warphole because in the first versions of it, the attracted particles where teleported to the "outer" universe once they reached a certain speed and distance to the core.
In the newest and final version the particles simply deattached themselves from the system and fleet towards infinity.

Sounds where produced with supercollider. I decided that the most natural way of giving a sound to the unhearable was to work with audio-feedback.
So, whenever two particles collided or where close enogough to each other, the microphone would open for a fragment of a second and will close again.
This provoked a modulated feedback through the granular interactions of the many particles in the system.
I used some resonant filters to avoid the feedback to grow towards unbearable levels.

The supercollider sketch is also here to download.

For flawless playback use Processing Legacy Version 2.1, updates are very welcome.
